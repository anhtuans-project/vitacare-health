# Gemini AI Integration Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Integration (`backend/routes/analyze.js`)
- ✅ Integrated Google's Gemini AI API for health analysis
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded responses with AI-powered analysis
- ✅ Added comprehensive prompt engineering for health consultation
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for API failures
- ✅ Added Vietnamese language support in prompts

### 2. Dependencies Added
- ✅ `@google/generative-ai` package installed
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with new dependency

### 3. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Added `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable support
- ✅ Created fallback for missing API key
- ✅ Updated test scripts to verify configuration

### 4. Testing & Validation
- ✅ Created `test-gemini.js` for API testing
- ✅ Updated `test-env.js` to check API key configuration
- ✅ Added npm scripts for easy testing

## How It Works

### Frontend Flow (TuViPage.jsx)
1. User fills in health information form:
   - Personal details (name, birth year, gender)
   - Symptoms description
   - Sleep habits
   - Health preferences/questions
2. Form data is sent to `/api/analyze-user` endpoint

### Backend Processing (analyze.js)
1. Receives user input data
2. Constructs a comprehensive prompt for Gemini AI including:
   - User's personal information
   - Health symptoms and concerns
   - Specific analysis requirements
3. Sends prompt to Gemini AI API
4. Receives AI-generated health analysis
5. Returns structured response to frontend

### AI Analysis Features
- **Personalized Health Assessment**: Based on user's specific symptoms
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies potential causes of health issues
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides specific steps for improvement
- **Prevention Strategies**: Suggests preventive measures
- **Medical Guidance**: Advises when to seek professional help

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in and create an API key
3. Copy the generated key

### 2. Configure Environment
Create `.env` file in backend directory:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

### 3. Test Integration
```bash
# Test environment variables
npm run test-env

# Test Gemini API connection
npm run test-gemini

# Start the server
npm run server
```

## API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/analyze-user`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Nguyễn Văn A",
  "birthYear": 1990,
  "gender": "male",
  "symptoms": "Mất ngủ, đau đầu",
  "sleepHabits": "Ngủ lúc 1h sáng",
  "preferences": "Muốn cải thiện giấc ngủ"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "name": "Nguyễn Văn A",
    "birthYear": 1990,
    "detailedAnalysis": "AI-generated health analysis in Vietnamese..."
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Missing API Key**: Graceful fallback with error message
- **API Failures**: Detailed error logging and user-friendly messages
- **Invalid Input**: Validation for required fields
- **Network Issues**: Proper timeout and retry handling

## Benefits

1. **AI-Powered Analysis**: More accurate and personalized health insights
2. **Scalable**: Can handle various health concerns and symptoms
3. **Vietnamese Support**: Native language health consultation
4. **Professional Quality**: Medical-grade analysis and recommendations
5. **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-understand health advice

## Security Considerations

- API key stored in environment variables (not in code)
- Input validation to prevent malicious prompts
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Rate limiting can be added if needed

## Future Enhancements

- Add conversation history for follow-up consultations
- Implement health tracking over time
- Add integration with health databases
- Support for image-based symptom analysis
- Multi-language support beyond Vietnamese
